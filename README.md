# ml-inference-web-app
Web-based machine learning/deep learning model inference & deployment. <br>
This app is still bounded for image classification, specifically in Rock/Paper/Scissors Image <br>

## System architecture
- Backend : Using Golang and Nginx as webserver <br>
- Frontend : Still in development, still use basic html <br>
- Deep Learning Model : using Tensorflow & Keras Model <br>

## How This App Works
1. At first, you will see the form asking for rock/paper/scissors image <br>
2. Upload the image for inference to the model, you will be redirected to another page <br>
3. Tadaa! see the classification result! br>

## Further Development
- Frontend Development to make web app display more interesting <br>
- Backend Development to broaden the scope of the inference (not only image, but also can video) <br>
- Data Security <br>
